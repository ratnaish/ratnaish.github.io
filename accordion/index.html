	Animals are sentient, individual beings who feel pain, fear, and joy. Yet every day, billions experience unbearable cruelty. Animals depend on us to give them the voice they deserve.

What makes WAP different from other charities?
<span></span>
</div>
<div>
    
	We start every conversation from the animalâ€™s perspective. We help people understand that each animal is an individual with the right to live a life free from cruelty and suffering. Additionally, we are the only global animal welfare organization with general consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and all its subsidiary bodies, enabling us to engage with and influence global decision-makers.
